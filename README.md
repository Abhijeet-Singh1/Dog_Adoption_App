## DOG ADOPTION APP

An application about adopting a shelter dog by finding through the website developed using React, Tailwind CSS and Jest.

## About

I developed this application as part of a take-home test provided by Fetch. I used React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Jest in the development process, ensuring that the website is responsive across different devices. I used Tailwind CSS because it provides utility classes, reducing the need to write custom CSS from scratch. Moreover, it simplifies the process of creating responsive designs and enhances user experience. I used Jest for doing unit tests because it is pretty easy to setup so we can directly dive into writing tests and its speed of execution if fast as it only executes the necessary tests and parallelizes the execution.

Features of the website:

1. Login, logout functionality.
2. Users can view dogs on the home screen.
3. Results are paginated which means users can press prev or next to switch the display.
4. Filter by Breeds Functionality.
5. Dog breeds are sorted in ascending order by default initially.
6. Ascending and descending the results functionality.
7. Users can add and remove multiple dogs as favorites.
8. Match will be generated out of added favorite dogs.
9. Email Validations on login.
10. Responsive layout.
11. Hamburger functionality in small screens.

## PREREQUISITES:

Clone the project into local <br>
Install all the npm packages. <br>
Go into the project folder and type the following command to install all npm packages
### `npm install`

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. <br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. <br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. <br>
See the section about running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder. <br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. <br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

### `npm run eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
